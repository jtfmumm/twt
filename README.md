A bash script for writing tweet sketches at the command line.    

# FAQ

Q: Is this yet another Twitter client?

A: No, it's just pure text, baby.  

Q: What's the point then?

A: Maybe you just want to get in the habit of composing short messages.  
   Maybe you'll copy and paste them from time to time into your Twitter client.  
   Maybe you just like menu-driven bash scripts.  

Q: Does it at least evaluate my tweets and give me feedback?

A: Not yet.  Not yet...

# Installation

At the command line:  
sudo chmod 755 install-twt.sh  
sudo ./install-twt.sh  

Run the program by typing
twt  

# Usage

You can add tweet sketches, delete them if you judge they're below your standards,
move them to the archive if you're sick of looking at them, and dump the archive to
a text file in case you want to save it for posterity.  

Now you can write pithy aphorisms in between command line tasks.  Don't abuse it.
